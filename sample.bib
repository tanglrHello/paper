@article{Li2004,
abstract = {In this paper, the usage and function of Chinese punctuations are studied in syntactic parsing and a new hierarchical approach is proposed for parsing long Chinese sentences. It differentiates from most of the previous approaches mainly in two aspects. Firstly, Chinese punctuations are classified as ‘divide' punctuations and ‘ordinary' ones. Long sentences which include ‘divide' punctuations are broken into suitable units, so the parsing will be carried out in two stages. This ‘divide-and-rule' strategy greatly reduces the difficulty of acquiring the boundaries of sub-sentences and syntactic structures of sub-sentences or phrases simultaneously in once-level parsing strategy of previous approaches. Secondly, a grammar rules system including all punctuations and probability distribution is built to be used in parsing and disambiguating. Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the time consumption and numbers of ambiguous edges of traditional methods, and also improve the accuracy and recall when parsing long Chinese sentences.},

@article{Xu2013,
abstract = {Chinese sentence segmentation is considered to be a very fundamental step in natural language processing. A successful solution for sentence boundary detection is a key step in the subsequent NLP tasks, such as parsing and machine translation, etc. In this paper, we consider comma as a sign-of-the-sentence boundary, and then divide it into two major types, i.e., the true (EOS) and the pseudo (Non-EOS). Finally, a system framework of Chinese sentence segmentation based on two-layer classifiers is presented and implemented. The experimental results on Chinese Treebank 6.0. Results show that our model achieve the F-measure of 90.7{\%} overall, which improves by 1.5{\%}.},
